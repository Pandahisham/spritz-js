		<p>Rebekah Brooks has told the phone-hacking trial she did not realise the practice was illegal when she was editor of the News of the World</p>
		<p>Mrs Brooks said she "didn't think anybody, me included, knew it was illegal".</p>

		<p>She told the Old Bailey she felt "shock and horror" after she discovered murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked.</p>

		<p>Mrs Brooks, one of seven defendants on trial, denies four charges.</p>

		<p>She said she was never asked to sanction the accessing of voicemails for a story during her time as editor of the newspaper.</p>

		<p>"No journalist ever came to me and said 'We're working on so and so a story but we need to access their voicemail and we need to ask for my sanction to do it'," she said.</p>

		<p>"Tell the police," Mrs Brooks said. "I would have assumed probably that they would have told the police before me. If they had not, I would have told them to do so."</p>
